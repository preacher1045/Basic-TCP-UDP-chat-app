# Basic-TCP-UDP-chat-app
This  project helps me to better understand  fundamental networking works

Here we are going to be looking at the following
-- OSI & TCP/IP models
-- Ip addressing and Subnetting
-- Sockets and  Server-Client Communication

Project Idea
We will be using pyhton SOCKETS library to build a  server-client chat app
For the first part of the  project, we are going to  use TCP which realiable but slow then later we include UDP which is unreliable but faster.
